# Shape Filling Challenge

Given an outline of a shape, I created a Custom U-Net Model to fill it inside the lines.
The shapes are be located at random in the image and have random parameters such as width, radius, height, etc. 
The goal is if an image is given to the model of the outline a filled-in version of that image will be returned.
